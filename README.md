This tool helps you analyze customer behavior over time and predict future purchases using cohort-based analytics, clustering, and machine learning.

---

##  Features

- Cohort analysis by time, product, country, and revenue
- Heatmaps and trend charts
- Clustering to identify customer segments
- Machine Learning to predict next purchases
- Saves clean datasets and reports to `charts/` and `outputs/`

```
Select index/indices for Country (comma-separated):
> 2,4
```

## Output

The tool saves results based on your selections:

###  In `charts/` Directory:
- Heatmap of retention
- Trend over time chart
- Customer segmentation clusters
- Feature importance from ML model

###  In `outputs/` Directory:
- Cleaned cohort data (`.csv`)
- ML classification report (`.txt`)
- Predicted next purchases (`.csv`)
